Multi-Valued Skyline Community Search

Code for the paper "**Skyline Community Search in Multi-valued Networks**", SIGMOD 2018. [[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3183736)]

This paper tries to handle the problem of identifying influential communities (i.e., skyline communities) from networks whose nodes have multiple attributes. 

Two algorithms are proposed. CommunitySearch.cpp corresponds to the basic algorithm, SkylineSearch.cpp corresponds to the space-partition algorithm. The basic algoritm is implemented in a straightforward way to make the problem we are dealing with much easier to understand.
